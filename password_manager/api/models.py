# This file is intentionally kept minimal
# Most models are defined in their respective app modules:
# - vault.models (for vault items, breach alerts, etc.)
# - auth_module.models (for authentication related models)
# - security.models (for security related models)

# If API-specific models are needed, they would be defined here
