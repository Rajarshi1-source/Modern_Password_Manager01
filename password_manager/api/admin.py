from django.contrib import admin

# This file is intentionally kept minimal
# Most models are registered in their respective app modules:
# - vault.admin (for vault items, breach alerts, etc.)
# - auth_module.admin (for authentication related models)
# - security.admin (for security related models)

# If API-specific models need admin registration, they would be added here
