Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: ab_testing, account, admin, adversarial_ai, analytics, auth, auth_module, authtoken, behavioral_recovery, blockchain, contenttypes, email_masking, fhe_service, logging_manager, ml_dark_web, ml_security, push_notifications, security, sessions, shared, sites, socialaccount, token_blacklist, user, vault
Running migrations:
  No migrations to apply.
  Your models in app(s): 'security' have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied.
  Run 'manage.py makemigrations' to make new migrations, and then re-run 'manage.py migrate' to apply them.
