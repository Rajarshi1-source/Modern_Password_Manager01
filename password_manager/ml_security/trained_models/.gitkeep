# This directory stores trained ML models
# Models are generated by running training scripts in ml_security/training/
#
# Expected files (after training):
# - password_strength_lstm.h5  (Password Strength LSTM Model)
# - isolation_forest.pkl       (Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection)
# - random_forest.pkl          (Random Forest Classifier)
# - kmeans.pkl                 (K-Means for Behavior Clustering)
# - scaler.pkl                 (Standard Scaler for feature normalization)
# - threat_analyzer_cnn_lstm.h5 (Hybrid CNN-LSTM Threat Analyzer)
#
# To train models:
# python manage.py shell
# >>> from ml_security.training.train_password_strength import train_model
# >>> train_model(samples=10000, epochs=50)
