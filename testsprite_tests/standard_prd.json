  },
  "product_overview": "SecureVault is a next-generation password manager offering advanced security through zero-knowledge client-side encryption, machine learning enhanced threat and password analysis, and support for post-quantum cryptography. It provides secure vault management for passwords and sensitive data with multi-platform accessibility including web, desktop, mobile, and browser extensions.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide unparalleled security using client-side encryption with zero-knowledge architecture ensuring server never sees plaintext data.",
    "Support modern authentication methods including password + MFA, passwordless WebAuthn/Passkeys, and OAuth social logins.",
    "Leverage post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber-768 hybrid) for encrypted vault items and communications.",
    "Enable fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to allow server-side computation on encrypted user data without exposure.",
    "Implement a comprehensive multi-factor and biometric authentication system to enhance user protection.",
    "Offer advanced recovery mechanisms including behavioral DNA verification and social mesh recovery to securely regain account access.",
    "Ensure high performance and scalability with multi-level caching, query optimization, and compression middleware.",
    "Provide cross-platform support with consistent user experience on web, desktop, mobile, and browser extension clients."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Zero-Knowledge Architecture: All encryption and decryption happen client-side with master password never sent to server; server stores only encrypted blobs.",
    "Comprehensive Authentication: Supports password + TOTP/SMS/Push MFA, WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkeys including biometric factors, OAuth 2.0 social logins (Google, GitHub, Apple).",
    "Post-Quantum Security: Hybrid CRYSTALS-Kyber-768 + X25519 key management and encryption with optimized Number Theoretic Transform for high performance.",
    "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): Multi-tier FHE integration allowing encrypted operations on server with caching and intelligent routing for performance.",
    "Secure Vault Management: CRUD operations on encrypted vault items, folder organization, shared folders with role-based access control, import/export and encrypted backups.",
    "Behavioral Biometrics and Recovery: Capture 247-dimensional behavioral DNA including keystroke, mouse, cognitive patterns for continuous auth and recovery.",
    "Dark Web and Threat Monitoring: Real-time breach alerts using machine learning models including BERT and Siamese networks.",
    "Multi-Level Caching and Compression: L1 memory, L2 Redis, and database caching combined with Gzip/Brotli response compression for efficient data transfer and fast operations.",
    "Session and Device Management: Secure session monitoring with auto-lock, device trust scoring, and emergency access with trusted contacts and waiting periods.",
    "Cross-Platform Deliverables: Web app in React, Electron desktop, React Native mobile, and browser extension with seamless synchronization and consistent security."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User registration via email with password creation, optionally setting up MFA or passkey authentication.",
    "Master password processed client-side using Argon2id KDF generating the encryption key; zero-knowledge auth hash sent to server for validation.",
    "Vault data encrypted on client with AES-256-GCM using derived keys before being sent to server for storage.",
    "Login flows supporting password + MFA, passwordless WebAuthn/passkeys with biometric authentication, or social logins via OAuth providers.",
    "Vault item management including creating, editing, organizing passwords, cards, notes, identities with real-time strength meter and secure encryption.",
    "Password generation using crypto-random secure options with ML-based strength feedback.",
    "Advanced recovery sequences where user can either recover using primary recovery keys or initiate behavioral DNA and guardian-based social mesh recovery requiring multi-day verification.",
    "FHE-enabled password strength checks and encrypted searches performed via intelligent routing between client, hybrid, and full FHE server computations with caching to reduce latency.",
    "Security dashboard displays breach alerts, device management, login history, and emergency access controls.",
    "Shared folders allow team collaboration with fine-grained role access and invitation management.",
    "Session auto-lock triggers key wipes on timeout; users can manage trusted devices and enable/disable device trust."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All sensitive user data is encrypted client-side before any transmission; server never receives plaintext credentials or encryption keys.",
    "Authentication flows correctly handle password-based, passkey-based, and OAuth login with enforced multi-factor authentication when required.",
    "Post-quantum cryptography operations demonstrate expected performance improvements via optimized NTT and caching layers.",
    "Fully homomorphic encryption operations complete successfully across tiers with correct encrypted results and efficient caching behavior.",
    "Vault API endpoints return encrypted data blobs with metadata-only queries providing faster metadata listings without exposing sensitive ciphertext.",
    "Behavioral recovery accurately captures and evaluates 247-dimension biometric data and challenges per defined thresholds for recovery approval.",
    "Security dashboards update and notify users immediately upon breach detection via WebSocket real-time alerts.",
    "Session management enforces automatic key clearance after inactivity and supports device trust evaluations with audit logging.",
    "Cross-platform clients synchronize encrypted vault data seamlessly with consistent behavior across platforms.",
    "Performance benchmarks validate at least 6x speedup in Kyber operations and 10x improvements in cache hit rates and API response times compared to baseline."
